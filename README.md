## Testing

All links have been tested and clicked on to confirm they are directing to the correct end-destination, both during the building of the site and a final check before deploying. 
During the building of the site there was a conistent check in preview window to see that all changes looked good and how (if) it affected the rest of the site. 

Setting up the site and it's structure and styling was quite unproblematic, going through one section at the time and testing it live before moving on to the next one. However I had the following issues:

* Container with width:100% changing size when inside button border expands 1px on hover
I could have change the 100% to fixed size but wanted it to be responsive to the screen and tried different position attributes but with no luck. In the end I got assistance from the support team to set position to absolute and height to fit-content. 

* I wanted to change margin-bottom on "p" descending of #form. This was good repetition of the _descending chapter_ however I realised that on the top of the terminal there is a "descending list" fo the elements and came to the understanding it was not a child of #form, but of <label>. Tried as id, class and then finally just label > h4 and it worked.

 * There were quite a few buttons I wanted centered within a container and the attribute "margin:0 auto;" didn't work. I realised I had to add a new "div" containing only button (because I didnâ€™t want all text to be centered, although that would have been the easiest) and added class="center". I could then change that div with text-align:center. 

* Cover image didn't show below header as I wanted. After some reasearch on Google I realised I had not added any height to the header section. When I did that the cover image was placed below as wanted.

* When making the site responsive it turned out I had a lot of padding on the right which pushed content to the left. I could not see this padding in the _Inspector_ at all and had to ask the tutors for help. With some suggestions to download the extension "Unicorn Reveler" I could see the padding that was disturbing the layout and reduce it to make it look nice. 

* In the first HTML check a header to the Gallery section was missed. I tried to add it but decided that visually it wouldn't look good and trust the images speak for themselves. I therefor decided to add it to the HTML file for screenreaders to see but to hide it for the viewers with CSS.
