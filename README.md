### Features Left to Implement

A potential webshop to sell small posters when the exhibition is on. 

## Testing

### Functionality Testing

All links have been tested and clicked on to confirm they are pointing to the correct end-destination, both during the building of the site and a final check before deploying. 
I used Chrome developer tools throughout the project for testing and solving problems with responsiveness and style issues and to see how changes effected the rest of the site. 

Unicorn Revealer extension to chrome browser was very helpful with a padding issue I could not find in Developer Tools. 

Setting up the site and it's structure and styling was quite unproblematic, going through one section at the time and testing it live before moving on to the next one. However I had the following issues:

* Container with width:100% changing size when inside button border gets bold on hover.
I could have changed the 100% container to fixed size but wanted it to be responsive to the screen and tried different position attributes but with no luck. In the end I got assistance from the support team to set position to absolute and height to fit-content. 

* I wanted to change margin-bottom on "p" descending from #form. After a few trial and errors I realised that on the top of the terminal there is a "descending list" of the elements and came to the understanding it was not a child of #form, but of _label_. I tried as id, class and then finally just label > h4 and it worked.

 * There were quite a few buttons I wanted centered within a container and the attribute "margin:0 auto;" didn't work. I realised I had to add a new "div" containing only the button (because I didnâ€™t want all text to be centered, although that would have been the easiest) and added class="center". I could then change that div with text-align:center attribute. 

* Cover image didn't show below header as I wanted. After some reasearch on Google I realised I had not added any height to the header section. When I did that the cover image was placed below as wanted.

* When making the site responsive it turned out I had a lot of padding on the right which pushed content to the left. I could not see this padding in the _Inspector_ at all and had to ask the tutors for help. With some suggestions to download the extension "Unicorn Reveler" I could see the padding that was disturbing the layout and reduce it to make it look nice. 

* In the first HTML check a header to the Gallery section was missed. I tried to add it but decided that visually it wouldn't look good and trust the images speak for themselves. I therefor decided to add it to the HTML file for screenreaders to see but to hide it for the viewers with CSS.

The site is made to be responsive to devices down to 500px and smaller. The aim was to keep the flow as much as possible but following changes was made responsive:

* At 1200px the Navigation bar doesn't fit the screen anymore so it was set to the left below the logo instead of to the right, and slightly smaller font size at this breakpoint.
* The About section has been split to two blocks on top of eachother on devices from 750px and smaller instead of side by side as it is on desktop view. The 750px was the breakpoint where it started to look unpleasant.
* At 500px and smaller all elements have been centralised for a nicer flow for the viewer. 

### Compatibility testing
Site was tested across multiple mobile devices and browsers. I checked all supported devices in Chrome Developer Tools with the smallest device being Iphone 5.
